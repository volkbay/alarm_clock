# alarm_clock
This is a hobby project to be embedded in a microcontroller, a simple alarm clock which can play different tunes and configured with an LCD screen and buttons. The code is in plain C language, depending on the [AVR Library](https://www.nongnu.org/avr-libc/).

## Components
The following components are the basic kinds, so I did not specify any model/brand:

- An ATMega8 Microcontroller (or anything compatible, ATTinys would do)
- An MCU programmer (in my case USBAspv2)
- 3v DC Power
- A Buzzer
- An LED
- 2 line simple LCD screen
- Resistors:
  - 5 x 10k ohm (buttons)
  - 1 x 1k ohm (LED)
  - 1 x less than 1k ohm (transistor to mcu)
- 5 x 1 nF Capacitors (debouncing)
- 4 x push buttons and 1 x on-off switch
- An NPN transistor (2N2222 etc.)
- 2 potentiometers [optional]

## A Most Professional Demo (sound on ðŸ”Š)
Here are some tunes of the alarm clock, they are irritating enough to wake you up in the morning ðŸŒž. Two potentiometers you'll see below are for adjusting LCD brightness and backlight, you may include them as you like (not shown in the schematic).

> **Note**
> I am aware some notes are a little of due to non-ideality of the MCU and components. They probably need some fine-tuning in `notes.h`, but I love them *flawed* like this.
